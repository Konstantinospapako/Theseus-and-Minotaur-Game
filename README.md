# Theseus and the Minotaur – A Night at the Museum

A programming project for the **Data Structures (2020–2021)** course  
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki – School of Electrical and Computer Engineering  

## 🧩 Overview
This project implements the *Theseus and the Minotaur* board game in Java, where two players — Theseus and the Minotaur — move across a maze-like board.  
Theseus aims to collect supplies and avoid capture, while the Minotaur is controlled by an **AI player** that uses the **MiniMax algorithm** and **heuristic evaluation functions** to decide its moves.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Concepts
- Java 8+
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data structures: trees, lists, arrays
- Algorithms: MiniMax, heuristic evaluation
- Game logic and AI movement

## 🧠 Main Classes
- `HeuristicPlayer`: Calculates the optimal move using heuristic logic.
- `MinMaxPlayer`: Implements the MiniMax algorithm to simulate an intelligent opponent.
- `Node`: Represents a node in the game’s decision tree.
- `Board`: Maintains the state of the game (tiles, players, supplies, and walls).

## 🕹️ How to Run
1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, or any Java IDE.
2. Ensure Java 8 or higher is installed.
3. Compile and run the main class (`Main.java` or equivalent).
4. Follow on-screen instructions to play or watch the AI simulation.
